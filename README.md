## Why?
Windows Media Player has an option to use UPnP™ and send media to it, but who use WMP?
Many users prefer other great Media Players such as: VLC, MPC or PotPlayer
But unfortunately these players doesn't have an UPnP™ renderer built in, so that's why I've developed this small software, so you could use any player on Windows to send and watch streams over UPnP™ protocol on your PC.
